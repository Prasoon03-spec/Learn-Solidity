# Learn-Solidity
This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Solidity, exploring the fundamentals of smart contract development, and steadily progressing toward advanced concepts in blockchain programming. It serves as a structured collection of my daily practice, exercises, mini-projects, and experiment-based smart contract implementations. Each folder in this repository reflects a specific topic I have learned—ranging from basic syntax, data types, functions, modifiers, and inheritance to more advanced areas such as events, error handling, interfaces, libraries, and contract security patterns. I regularly update this repo with new code samples, challenges, and real-world smart contract examples as I continue to deepen my understanding of Ethereum and the EVM. The goal of this repository is not only to track my personal growth but also to provide a clean reference for anyone beginning their Solidity journey. Over time, this repo will evolve into a complete archive of my progress, documenting my transition from basic learning exercises to building production-ready decentralized application components and secure smart contracts.
